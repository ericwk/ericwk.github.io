# Eric Kleinschmidt
## Data scientist

<p class="message">
  Hey there! This page is about me and my journey to become a data scientist.  My interest in data science comes from a passion to improve the success rate of innovation to drive business growth.  Innovation that leads to business growth involves understanding a market need and understanding how to meet that need via a solution that people will use to improve their lives (provides added value). Data is the lowest level of understanding.  Data by itself has no value beyond its potential to be transformed into understanding that adds value, which we might define as 'wisdom'.  

  To me, data science is the process of transforming data into a shared understanding and ideally into shared wisdom.  Business growth through innovation is a potential outcome of shared wisdom that adds value to the lives of the people involved.  This is the application of data science that I am interested in and passionate about.
