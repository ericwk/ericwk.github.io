## Data scientist

<p class="message">
  Hey there! This page is about me and my journey to become a data scientist.  My interest in data science comes from a passion to improve the success rate of innovation to drive business growth.  Innovation that leads to business growth involves understanding a market need and understanding how to meet that need via a solution that people will use to improve their lives (provides added value). Data is the lowest level of understanding.  Data by itself has no value beyond its potential to be transformed into understanding that adds value, which we might define as 'wisdom'.  

  To me, data science is the process of transforming data into a shared understanding and ideally into shared wisdom.  Business growth through innovation is a potential outcome of shared wisdom that adds value to the lives of the people involved.  This is the application of data science that I am interested in and passionate about.

A popular definition of the data science process is
1. Problem formulation
2. Data acquisition
3. Data wrangling/cleaning
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Feature engineering
6. Modeling: build, fit, validate
7. Data storytelling, sharing understanding and finding value ('wisdom')

This is the process applied to the project repositories linked on this page.  Early repositories are for five projects that were a part of the Metis bootcamp that I attended in Chicago during July through September 2018.  The final form of the early repositories represents what was done during the 1-3 week period applied to each project during the bootcamp.  The blog posts for each discuss data science material learned during that time and connect this material to the project and discuss the wisdom derived from each.
