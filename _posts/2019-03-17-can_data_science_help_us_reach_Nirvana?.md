title: Can Data Science Help Us Reach Nirvana
---

In Buddhism, Nirvana is the goal.  Because the goal is never reached, it is the journey that is important.  Nirvana literally means "quenching" or "blowing out" as in blowing out a candle [(see)](https://tricycle.org/magazine/nirvana-2).  What is extinguished with Nirvana is the triple fire of greed, hatred and delusion and transforming these into peace, compassion and deep spiritual joy.  I think that most of us would agree that moving forward on the journey toward Nirvana would be good for all of us, although we may choose to describe it differently.

Can data science help us move forward on this journey?  I think, similar to the journey toward Nirvana, that the journey is more important than the answer.  I am on that journey and perhaps what I learn along the way can be helpful to others.  Because I am an engineer I believe that data can move us forward on any journey (or perhaps because I believe this I am an engineer).  Let's get started.

Given that data science has "science" in its name, perhaps scientists can help us better understand what it is.

Scientists studied the process of converting data into wisdom and proposed a model <sup>1,2,3</sup>. This model is known as the "DIKW model" and is illustrated below.

The endpoint of this process is wisdom.  What is wisdom?  One definition is "the ability to use knowledge and experience to make good decisions and judgements" [see](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/wisdom).

We did not call these scientists "data scientists" and the field of thinking about this process is relatively narrow.  Other scientists were busy making observations (creating data) and trying to figure out how to use it to become wise.  Mathematics was developed and advanced as a language to support this process (as well as for other reasons), and from it came statistics and predictive algorithms to support making predictions.  Good predictions are important to wisdom.  Eventually, engineers came along to try to do something with this data (often before it became wisdom) and to help with finding wisdom.  

As we advanced mathematics, we discovered that it could help us explain many complex processes and that it, when combined with statistical methods, could help us make very good predictions.  So good that some mathematical equations took on the name "law" because when we apply them with data from the real world nothing but the predicted result has ever been observed.  As we have learned more, we have sometimes needed to put boundaries on these laws because we have found some situations ("data sets") in which the laws do not make accurate predictions.

The mathematical calculations needed to predict the outcome of complex processes across many situations (with "bigger data sets") took a long time and often produced errors.  Confidence in a prediction required repeating the calculations to confirm accuracy.  Much time could pass to complete these calculations before wisdom was achieved.

Information technology (IT) and the computer hardware that drives it helped speed up these calculations.  Scientists thought about the application of IT to capturing and making use of data and came up with a model for the process.  This model is known as the information systems view of how data can be processed <sup>1,4</sup> to provide value and is illustrated below.

This model suggests that IT can help us on our journey toward wisdom.  I propose that wisdom can help us on our journey to Nirvana if we choose appropriate goals for our decisions and judgements for which we seek wisdom.  

Business is the means by which many of us seek to make our lives better.  I suggest that business can help us along our journey to Nirvana if we extend its goal to make lives better to others as well as ourselves, and to broaden our definition of value beyond a cash on hand calculation.  Otherwise, we risk using business as a tool to advance our greed, which would definitely interfere with our journey to Nirvana.  Business can help us with our journey to Nirvana if we choose a goal for business of making the lives of all of those involved better.  Making lives better requires changing something, doing something new.  I choose doing these new things as my definition for innovation.  Risk (of making life worse) is inevitably involved in any decision we take when choosing to do something new, choosing to innovate.  Innovation is consistent with the journey to Nirvana if risk is shared willingly and knowingly (as well as can be achieved with current knowledge) by everyone involved.

If we take this goal for business, then business can help us move forward on our journey to Nirvana.  We can then focus on whether of not data science can help us move our businesses forward and our answer will apply to get us closer to Nirvana as well.  I believe that data science can help us improve business success and therefore can help us reach Nirvana.  That will be the focus of my journey.  More specifically, I will focus on using data science to be more successful with innovation as a means to improve business performance.
